//TODO: These should be thread-safe. Update the documentation as well.
//TODO: A different approach is to employ the Abstract Factory pattern. Clients would use factories to create matrices, instead
//      of constructors or static factory methods. These factories would have different implementations: MKL, Managed, CUDA, etc.
//      Advantage: the client could use simultaneously more than one providers. Disadvantages: 1) A lot of methods would need 
//      references to the factory objects (this could be circumvented with singletons/ enum classes) 2) What happens for matrices
//      or vectors that need e.g. both a BLAS and a SuiteSparse provider?
//TODO: The initialization should be done at the beginning of the program to avoid interference with timing.
//TODO: The name dll in the comments of this class and the providers is too windows oriented. Once I have installed the native 
//      libraries for other operating systems, I need to stop calling them dlls.
